It's time to get quirky, let's play some Alquerque!

You can hear the crowd cheer, but first let's get the rules clear...

With an attitude like that you won't get into heaven, so please just pick a number between 1 and 7.

This is the board we'll be playing on tonight. Get to know it now, so you don't end up losing sight.

It's time to get started, so find your laminar flow. Let's hope your hands are steady. Ready, set, go!
