It's time to get quirky, let's play some Alquerque!

But just before we get started, let's get the game charted...
You can hear the crow cheer, but first let's get a couple things clear...
Get your brain in high-gear, but first let's get the rules clear...

Will you stand in the limelight or will you let the AI be white? (y/n)
This is not the time to debate human rights,
so please just decide if the AI should play white? (y/n)
    Please just type y or n, it's all that we need.
    You know who'd be proud of you? Frances Shand Kydd.

If you need to hit the sack, will you just let the AI play black? (y/n)
If you need to fight off an arson attack, just let the AI play black? (y/n)
    I really am feeling the rhythm and blues,
    a simple y or n, that's all you have to choose.

We crafted this software, it's a true piece of art,
now decide, should the AI be dumb or smart? (1-7)
    With that attitude you won't come into heaven,
    so please just pick a number between 1 and 7.

It's time to get started, find your laminar flow. Let's hope your hands are steady. Ready, set, go!

You fought with all your might and the game is now done,
so it's a pleasure to announce that ... won!

This game was as complex as the United States national law,
but in the end 'twas for nothing, it ended in a draw.
